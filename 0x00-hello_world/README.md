Why was C invented, and who invented it?
Contrary to belief, C is actually not awesome, and is a very complicated programming language
to learn, due to the level of depth you can reach inside the computer and instruct it to
perform low-level functions and tasks. That is to be expected, as the programmer who created the
C programming language, Dennis Ritchie, was an old-school programmer. So old-school, in fact, he
was the creator and contributed to many a technological progression related to the computer science
industry.

Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds?
Dennis Ritchie is the creator of the C programming language and contributed to the development of the
UNIX operating system, along with Brian Kernighan, who also co-authored what is considered the C 
programming language bible, with Ritchie. Linus Torvalds, a mastermind in his own respect, built
heavily upon the UNIX operating system to create the most popular Windows and OS X alternative
operating system, Linux.
